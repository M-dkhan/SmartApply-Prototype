Architecture Overview
Job Classes
Base Class: This serves as a template for job objects. It might include common attributes like job title, URL, location, role type, position, requisition ID, and description.
Portal-Specific Classes: Derive from the base job class and include additional attributes or methods specific to each job portal like Workday and SuccessFactors.
Scraper Classes
BaseScraper: Contains generic scraping methods that can be used across different job portals. This would handle tasks common to all scraping operations, such as initializing the driver, navigating to the main job listing page, and closing connections.
PortalSpecificScraper: Inherits from BaseScraper and implements specific scraping logic for each job portal. This includes fetching job listings and extracting detailed job information.
Implementation Steps
fetchJobs(): This method should navigate to the main job listing page and collect a list of available jobs, typically by capturing the links to the detailed job pages.
Details Extraction Methods: Once you have a job URL from fetchJobs(), you can use the URL to navigate to the detailed job page and extract information using the following methods:
fetchTitle()
fetchApplyUrl()
fetchLocation()
fetchRoleType()
fetchPosition()
fetchRequisitionId()
fetchDescription()
